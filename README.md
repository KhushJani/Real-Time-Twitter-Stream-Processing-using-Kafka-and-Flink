# Real-Time-Twitter-Stream-Processing-using-Kafka-and-Flink

This project focuses on the analysis of a COVID-19 related
tweet data set collected in April 2020. Employing distributed
technologies, specifically Apache Spark and Apache
Kafka within the Docker environment, a reliable and scalable
framework is established. The primary objectives include
exploring the data set and understanding public sentiments.
Apache Spark, with its layered architecture, and Apache
Kafka, a resilient data handling system, form a dynamic platform
allowing parallel analysis. The chosen technologies,
along with Dockerâ€™s support for dynamic scaling, contribute
to efficient data processing and scalability.
The study utilizes the "Coronavirus (covid19) Tweets - early
April" dataset from Kaggle, emphasizing key features such
as dynamic scaling, fault tolerance, reliability, and resource
sharing (12). Results from exploratory analysis reveal insights
into tweet length distribution, sentiment polarity, and
visualizations through t-SNE, showcasing the effectiveness
of the distributed system in handling large datasets. In
conclusion, the project demonstrates the value of distributed
technologies in real-world applications, particularly in the
context of analyzing COVID-19-related tweets.
